## What I do

My intention regarding the content of this blog[^1] is that it would provide an informative, interesting personal perspective on various sexual topics. I am open to reviewing any body-safe, non-porous[^2] toy that comes from a respectable retailer/manufacturer[^3]. 

Beyond toy reviews, I aim to publish my thoughts on various subjects surrounding masturbation, self-care, health, and social/political problems. The views expressed on this blog are mine alone; I don't publish guest posts or posts that are essentially ad copy.

I reserve the right to publish my honest thoughts about any product received in exchange for review. A review or mention of any company/person does not constitute an endorsement of or affiliation with that entity. Furthermore, I reserve the right to rescind any affiliation established in the event that I *do* explicitly associate with a company or person, and no longer wish to at some later point in time.

## Blog Content

I take responsibility for, and ownership of, everything I publish on this blog. There is a moderated comment section that I've left on my posts, which means that some "content" on this site will come from others, not necessarily myself. In the event that I fail to remove comments that go against my comment policy[^4], understand that those comments are the responsibility and property of their poster, not of myself nor Disqus.

[^2]: There are, of course, some products that are pthalate-free but porous; I may be open to reviewing sleeves or other external toys that fit this description.
[^3]: I do not support, and, if possible, will not recommend, that people purchase products from companies that have engaged in documented deplorable behavior, e.g., Pipedream.
