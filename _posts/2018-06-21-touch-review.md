The We-Vibe Touch is a quality vibrator. Along with the Tango, it’s praised all over the sex toy world. My thoughts are a little different.

Now, the main reason I’d like to write a different sort of review on the Tango/Touch is because of how good they are. *Tons* of women(and men) love the motor these vibrators share to death(la petite mort). This is great for them, but I do think there are a few caveats that ought to be noted before one springs for either toy.

1. There are some fairly-commonly reported issues regarding the lifespan of the T/T motor.
2. The charger is notoriously finicky and problem-prone.
3. The battery life might not be enough for you, and can start to wane.

I haven’t experienced either of these problems myself. My Touch has, on occasion, randomly turned off during use, as if it died…but then clicked right back on again. The charger *is* finicky, but I definitely haven’t had any real trouble charging it. I just get it in the right spot and leave it in a position where it hopefully won’t slip or disconnect somehow. So mine has been fine since I’ve bought it. But there’s another important caveat there–I really don’t use it that much, while others need theirs to come, and end up using it all the time.

My personal qualm with the Touch is just that it doesn’t seem to be what my clit really wants or likes. So far, it’s my only luxury external vibrator (and was my first) so, in the end, I probably had to just jump for a toy and start to learn what my vibration preferences were. I think it’s just too strong and firm for me, so I’ve started looking at what might be a good attempt #2.

The Touch taught me that I like pinpoint over broad stimulation, and that I still like to be able to use pressure even with vibrations. Most ~~clitically~~ critically, though, I’ve got a hunch that I’d like a less-powerful vibrator, which isn’t something one hears a lot in the sex toy world.

Wha I like most about the Touch is its shape, which allows for a lot of experimentation as to what size range suits you best, and where. Pinpoint here, use the back for broad, use the side/spoon-shaped front to cup or cradle your clitoris. So many options!
