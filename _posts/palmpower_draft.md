DRAFT

BMS PalmPower thoughts

------

1. it's strong, if you're looking for something stronger than say a We-Vibe Touch
2. it starts off pretty storng as it is. starts off stronger than the Swan Wand does, and ends way faster/stronger.
3. it's rumbly all the way through though, even though it gets fast and really strong.
4. it's cheesy but the thing really packs a punch.
5. small potential con; there's only one button AND powerbullet/bms controls are different than most vibes
6. bonus: there are different heads/attachments
7. bonus: it's all body safe silicone, and you can take it wherever(waterproof, cordless), plus it's lighter than full-sized wands, obviously.
8. price. it's a great price and you get aspects that more expensive wands have.
9. good body-safe option if you want something more powerful than even a powerhouse small external/clit vibe like the Tango, but you don't want what comes with the larger wands, whether that be too much power, noise, bulk, expense, or too little portability.

draft:

The PalmPower is like a small SUV/crossover vehicle. You get the benefits of both worlds of external/"clitoral" vibes: small toys that can fit in your hand, and full-size wands that you plug into a wall and cause earthquakes. There's obviously going to be more headroom for power in a large mains-powered wand like a Doxy, but the PalmPower still has plenty of rumble and power to go 'round.

For me the bottom line for recommending this toy is that you can get a lot more power than a We-Vibe Touch or Tango in what is still a relatively small package. 

What about other wands? A huge number of people wonder about the logistics of using a wand(*the* wand...the Magic Wand in particular, since it's the most well-known out there) during partnered sex; it's a legitimate worry. Another factor is that in my experience, when people talk about how they(or their partner) use the Magic Wand, they mention that they have to dampen the vibrations through cloth of some sort. The original Magic Wand is still one of the strongest vibrators out there (I've only heard some fellow reviewers say that Doxy beats it, but that's about it), but its power options are limited to two. Otherwise you have to buy an additional accessory to further modify the levels of vibration.

Some luxury wands have tackled problems that came with the Magic Wand, but they're expensive (Le Wand, O Wand, Doxy Wands).

When I was testing the palmPower I brought out my Swan Wand after a while and realizes that the PalmPower is even stronger than it. Now, the Swan Wand has a hugely different set up that makes it hard to compare the two toys directly, but if we're just going by power, the Palm Power wins. It starts off stronger and ends *much* faster than the Swan.Like I can't stress that enough, lol. I was holding down the button to increase the speed and it just. kept. going. Considering the praise I read on the Swan Wand before I bought it myself (from people that have much more hardy clits than I) for the Swan Wand's vibrations and power, I think it's a useful comparison to make.

The PalmPower is like, a Goldilocks wand to me (conceptually) when I think about all it offers for its price ($69, nice). It's body-safe (completely; the Doxy Original and the Magic Wand don't have silicone heads), it's powerful, *waterproof*, there are attachments available, it's cordless, and it's slimâ€“not cumbersome or heavy.

The only con I can think of is that you have one button that you press-and-hold to increase the level of vibrations. In a way it's actually a pro and a con, since this means you can stop wherever you like instead of having, say, 5 levels that you click through with a button. Power is a spectrum with this toy. However, I don't think I've seen this outside of BMS' Powerbullet toys, so it'll be different from other toys that you own.

The reason I'm writing about it's qualities so much and not about the orgasms it gave me is because the PalmPower is simply too strong for me. I *tried*, damnit, but I really am whatever the opposite of a power queen is. However, I tried to use a We-Vibe Touch for like a year, and I can say with total confidence that the PalmPower is much stronger than the Touch (or the Tango). This is how I know it'll be a great option for anyone that wants broader, rumbly stimulation. It's the wand that would be least disruptive during partnered sex as well, I think. Plus, you can take it with you anywhere without having to worry about plugging in.
