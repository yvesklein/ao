I asked to Tri-It so you don't have to!

I could totally go on a rant about how weird the design is, but I'm not against unique toys. I could slam the name and how it seems like it betrays Screaming O!'s poor design here. But what really puts me off this toy is that the vibrations aren't good(they start to feel uncomfortably buzzy/numbing/itchy to me pretty quick) and the 2/3 of the arms might as well not be there. These factors make the price seem like an error to me.

### My issues with it

It's just...it doesn't make sense to me? The shape is bizarre in that the aux-nubs are useless, yet the trio of nubs is supposed to be the point of the toy. Yet I don't see how they're stimulating at all. The stems for the nubs are pretty flexible, and so I can't get any pressure from them. Worse, the vibrations seem to be dampened and suppressed immediately upon contact. The only one that vibrates even when pressed against skin is the primary/middle prong. So as far as getting multiple points of contact...the Tri-It fails.

The vibrations are also pretty buzzy, though they do get pretty forceful on the highest levels.

A small nitpicky thing is that there's a pretty noticeable seam on the body of the toy, but I'm thinking that with the price tag on this toy, it shouldn't be there. The Tri-It doesn't seem quite as refined as a near-$80 toy should be in my mind. As an example, Je Joue seems to be able to do a lot better for even less with their bullet series. To be honest, I didn't know the price of the Tri-It while I was testing it, and I didn't expect to find that it wasn't a $40 toy. 

### Where it's okay

The Tri-It *is* made of body-safe silicone all over and is rechargeable. At least there's that.

One good thing is that the controls are +/-, not just one button. There are a ton of power increments and patterns available, so it would be pretty unacceptable if you'd have to cycle through all of those just to get back to whatever one you liked. I hope this becomes standard on all toys, even toys with only a handful of levels and patterns. It's a *lot* nicer to be able to go back and forth.

### Alternatives

As far as triple contact goes, I don't know of many toys that have this feature. I've seen the JimmyJane Love Pods Tre, but nothing else.

But double-contact toys exist aplenty! There's the [Je Joue Rabbit Bullet Vibrator](https://www.bevibrant.com/products/je-joue-rabbit-bullet-vibrator?rfsn=1509055.df2dc&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1509055.df2dc), the [Gala by We-Vibe](https://www.bevibrant.com/products/we-vibe-gala-vibrator?variant=5241690783783&rfsn=1509055.df2dc&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1509055.df2dc), and JimmyJane's [Intro](https://www.bevibrant.com/products/jimmyjane-intro-2-vibrator?rfsn=1509055.df2dc&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1509055.df2dc)/[Form 2](https://www.bevibrant.com/products/jimmy-jane-form-2?rfsn=1509055.df2dc&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1509055.df2dc) to name a few.

For variety's sake, in case there are some people really holding out for a triple-contact external vibrator, I hope something better comes out. But if you're looking for more than one vibrating point...I wouldn't "tri" the Tri-It, I'd go with the Je Joue Rabbit Bullet.
