title: Five Basic Sexcessories!
---

Here are five items I find I use a lot when I’m using toys/masturbating in general. 

{: .lead}

They’re useful for all kinds of sex! There are wayyy more hugely useful tools–like Liberator Throes instead of towels–that people use, but this list is about stuff you already have.

<!--break-->

- **A couple cloths**: towel(s), hand towel(s), washcloths. I like to wet the washcloths beforehand and use one to wipe my lube-y hands. The other is for wiping myself down if *I’m* lube-y (among other things) just to feel better until I can shower if I need to. Especially with anal play, all the lube necessary doesn’t feel great on my body afterwards.

- **A robe**: I'm not in my house's master bedroom, so when I have to walk from my room to the bathroom or elsewhere in the middle of being naked it's nice to not have to actually put on clothes. I *have* actually had to like stop, get up and sign for a package, or go talk to people at my door just as I was getting down to business. Usually this means no time to put a whole outfit on. My robe is actually a men’s robe so it’s got great coverage, is thick, and has pockets!

- **A container for holding toys/other things** "in play," "on the bench," or...ok I'm out of metaphors. Basically, I use this container I have to hold sex toys on my nightstand while I'm masturbating, and I use it to carry them all back and forth to/from the bathroom for cleaning. It’s so useful to me I’m probably going to buy something dedicated to use for this purpose, since I’m just using a generic plastic “mesh basket” at the moment.


- **Drinks/snacks**: seriously, lol. I can end up parched and hungry from my sessions. It's nice to just be able to grab a glass of water/cup of tea on hand or [take a bite of a juicy peach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1Y3R0wVRQ). [Or drink some apricot juice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4grnewqeCk). Whatever you like. Involvement of gay stone fruit like avocados or the above is optional, but fun. I honestly find there is actual potential for eroticism in eating fruit[^1]. 


- **A thermos**: if you have metal or glass toys that you like to heat up, it can be tricky to actually keep them warm for when you are ready to play with them. At least I found it tricky. My kitchen's all the way downstairs, damnit. So I use one of those containers that keeps your coffee hot, but just for hot water, and I use that to heat my nJoy Pure Wand when I'm ready for it. You could probably also use this to heat lube and keep it warm: just put the bottle/tube in the thermos full of warm(obviously not too hot) water.

What handy sexcessories do you use regularly?
