## Welcome to my sex blog, **solochro.me**

#### Self Q&A

> What kind of name is that?

Instead of monochrome, I went with 'solo'-chrome because monochro.me was taken.

> Ok, but why 'monochrome' in the first place?

I felt inspired by the lesbian flag and the classic gay pride flag. I also like the way that they're icons that show and embody a sort of progression; the '*chrome*' part of the name, in the context of a sex blog, evokes those colors for me.
    
> What do you think you're doing, exactly?

I want to explore, discover, and enjoy my sexuality and my body; I thought a blog would be an interesting and especially illuminating way to do this, because it forces me to express myself safely regarding topics that are otherwise kept quiet in my life.

> Who are you?

Call me ~~by your name~~ Jean. I'm a cis[^1] lesbian in my 20's. Apart from being an amateur sex blogger, I'm a student and writer. I love art. I'm vegan.

> How can I/my company work with you?

Please have a look at my [policies page](www.solochro.me/policies), then contact me at hello@solochro.me.
