## Welcome to my sex blog, *amoromnib.us.*

- What kind of name is that?
    - I took it from the Latin phrase *amor omnibus idem*, meaning (in some sense\*) "love is the same for all." Why? Because it's an inclusive name/concept and it's a nod to the wonder of human sexuality. Also, pride.

- Who are you?
    - Call me ~~Ishmael~~ ~~by your name~~ Jean. I'm a cis lesbian in my 20's that wants to explore, discover, and enjoy my sexuality and my body; I thought a blog would be an interesting and especially illuminating way to do this, because it forces me to express myself safely w/r/t topics that are otherwise kept quiet.
    - Otherwise, I'm a student and writer. I love art. I'm vegan.

\*Obviously, translations vary, and there's an entire book of context around it, but that's part of the gist.

> *Nay, every race on earth of men, and beasts,

> And ocean-folk, and flocks, and painted birds,

> Rush to the raging fire: love sways them all.*
