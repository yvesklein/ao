# Buying Toys

## Where to buy: the best online shops (NA)

## [Vibrant](http://www.bevibrant.com?rfsn=1509055.df2dc&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1509055.df2dc)

[Vibrant](http://www.bevibrant.com?rfsn=1509055.df2dc&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1509055.df2dc) is an excellent shop that works with the Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. While at any point in time it'd be a great idea to support PP, thanks to the changes in the Supreme Court (fuck you Kennedy), we're moving even further into a potential political danger zone for Roe v. Wade and reproductive rights/health.

Their mission:

> **Vibrant is dedicated to providing a space without stigma for all people to take control of their sex life with fun body-safe and quality products.** 

Pretty rad.

## [Peepshow Toys](http://www.peepshowtoys.com#oid=91554_4244)

Like Vibrant, [Peepshow Toys](http://www.peepshowtoys.com#oid=91554_4244) exclusively stocks non-porous, body-safe toys. They support the sex blogging community beautifully and have a great curated selection of toys, lube, and other accesories.

## [Shevibe](www.shevibe.com)

Perhaps the biggest and most beloved retailer in the sex blogger world. They have some porous toys, but only stock pthalate-free material in that area. Otherwise, they have a huge selection of body safe toys and their prices are good to boot. Their distinctive comic-style branding is awesome and they have a lot of unique product offerings (*adult* coloring books, for example). Often the first place I see many bloggers point people looking for toys because they have so many!

## [Luvoqa](www.luvoqa.com)

Another strictly body-safe, non-porous retailer with a carefully put-together selection of toys and accessories. They're inclusive and professional, and offer free ground shipping on all orders. That's bomb.

Use the code SOLO for fast 2-3 day shipping on orders above $75.

## [Smitten Kitten](www.smittenkittenonline.com)

A smaller indie shop based in Minnesota. Inclusive, body-safe exclusive, and stocks some toys you can't find many other places. [They have an awesome focus on education](https://www.smittenkittenonline.com/pages/resources) that I personally really appreciate.

## [Unbound](www.unboundbabes.com)

Small selection of body-safe toys, but with a very accessible presentation and branding that sets them apart. They offer a subscription box, which I've not seen from other retailers, so if that's your thing...

# FAQ

### Discreet Shipping/Billing?

The shops above all ship and bill discreetly; they're trustworthy. There **are** some shops to avoid, namely Adam & Eve(sends NSFW mail to your address) and EdenFantasys(reportedly shitty service and mistreatment of affiliates/customers/employees).

If you want to hear it straight from the horse's mouth, you can find shipping information on the specific store's website.

### Safety?

The shops I linked above sell body-safe toys exclusively. Some stock a few porous toys(usually external toys; sleeves are often made of elastomer/TPE). If you want to support the #BoycottToxicToys movement, you can make your choice from among the retailers I listed.

### Amazon/eBay/AliExpress/Wish?

Wish/AliExpress/eBay? Please, god, no.

Amazon? Also dicey, but not as bad as the others. To be honest, I bought one of my first dildos on Amazon. That was a Tantus toy though, and they do sell their stock on Amazon.

See my articles on these retailers and on cheap(not necessarily equivalent to *inexpensive*) sex toys.

I use some affiliate links in this post and around my blog. If you don't like that, don't click them. If you don't mind using them, it's an easy way to support the blog as I get a little kickback from each sale made from my links. Either way, thanks for reading.
