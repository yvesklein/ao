# Buying Toys

## Where to buy: the best online shops (NA)

## [Vibrant](http://www.bevibrant.com?rfsn=1509055.df2dc&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1509055.df2dc)

[Vibrant](http://www.bevibrant.com?rfsn=1509055.df2dc&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1509055.df2dc) is an excellent shop that works with the Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. While at any point in time it'd be a great idea to support PP, thanks to the changes in the Supreme Court, we're moving even further into a potential political danger zone for Roe v. Wade and reproductive rights/health.

Their mission:

> **Vibrant is dedicated to providing a space without stigma for all people to take control of their sex life with fun body-safe and quality products.** 

Pretty rad.

# FAQ

### Discreet Shipping/BIlling?

The shops above all ship and bill discreetly; they're trustworthy. There **are** some shops to avoid, namely Adam & Eve(sends NSFW mail to your address) and EdenFantasys(reportedly shitty service and mistreatment of affiliates/customers/employees).

If you want to hear it straight from the horse's mouth, you can find shipping information on the specific store's website.

### Safety?

The shops I linked above sell body-safe toys exclusively. Some stock a few porous toys(usually external toys; sleeves are often made of elastomer/TPE). If you want to support the #BoycottToxicToys movement, you can make your choice from among the retailers I listed.

### Amazon/eBay/AliExpress/Wish?

Wish/AliExpress/eBay? Please, god, no.

Amazon? Also dicey, but not as bad as the others. To be honest, I bought one of my first dildos on Amazon. That was a Tantus toy though, and they do sell their stock on Amazon.

Read Erika Lynae and Dangerous Lilly's articles on buying from Amazon and similar retailers.

See my articles on these retailers and on cheap(not necessarily equivalent to *inexpensive*) sex toys.

I use some affiliate links in this post and around my blog. If you don't like that, don't click them. If you don't mind using them, it's an easy way to support the blog as I get a little kickback from each sale made from my links. Either way, thanks for reading.
