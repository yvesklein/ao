# Ways to Support My Work

---

If you'd like to help me keep this going and do even better, you have some options!

### Use my affiliate links when you buy toys.

This one's definitely the easiest. Just buy toys and whatnot like usual, but after accessing the site/product via one of the links around the blog or on the [toybox](toybox) page.

### Buy me a cuppa (a donation of a few dollars).

The trope seems to be coffee, but we can imagine it's any drink, or perhaps not a drink at all.

- Here's my [Ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/solochrome) page
- And my [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/solochrome) page

### Send some crypto, if you're into that

- BTC
- IOTA
- ETH
- DASH
- XMR
- LTC

As always, thanks for reading and presumably liking solochrome. If nothing else, you can support my work by telling me how you think I can make it better. Drop me a line in the comments or via email any time! It also helps a lot if you share what you like, or what has been useful to you, through social media and whatnot. That's what I want to do, really: help people with their sexual lives (myself included, tbh).

Thanks,
Jean
